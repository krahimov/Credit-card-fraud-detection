Credit card fraud is a significant threat in the BFSI sector. This credit card fraud detection system studies and analyzes user behavior patterns and uses location scanning techniques to identify any unusual patterns. One of The user patterns includes important user behavior like spending habits, usage patterns, etc. The system uses geographic location for identity verification. In case it detects any unusual pattern, the user will be required to undergo the verification process again.
